## Devnagari-Handwritten-Hindi-Character-Classification-Problem
## Nvidia Hackathon primary round project

To solve this problem we initially made some artificial datasets and then trained with both LeNet_5 and Inception_Net Architectures. We chose the later one as it given us better accuracy. You can find the trained model("inception_final_model.h5") inside "Models.zip".

Val_Accuracy = 0.9994 (from Inception_Net Architecture) , Total Loss = 0.0145
